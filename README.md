## 🎯 **Why This Approach?**

Traditional portfolios can feel static and impersonal. By creating an interactive desktop environment, I aim to:

1. **Demonstrate Technical Skills**: The portfolio itself showcases web development capabilities
2. **Create Memorable Experiences**: Visitors will remember the unique interface
3. **Tell a Story**: Navigate through my journey like exploring a digital workspace
4. **Show Personality**: The custom environment reflects creativity and attention to detail
